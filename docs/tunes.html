            <q class="lyrics-line">Drift all you like, from ocean to ocean</q>
            <p>
              i think this line is someone leaving someone behind in search of a new thing, drifting away. searching oceans to find this thing they're looking
              for.
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">Search the whole world</q>
            <p>
              this line relates to the previous line for someone looking for something, or something else. never giving up looking for it.
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs, will just make you more alone</q>
            <p>
              this line is saying that the person searching for this thing is stupid, they're searching for something to make them less alone. but the lies they
              spread will not help them find this new thing
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">When you come home I'll bake you a cake</q>
            <p>
              when the person finally stops searching for the thing that makes them less alone, they'll come home. and i'll be waiting, the thing they were searching for
              was to get away from me.
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">Made of all their eyes</q>
            <p>
              this is getting revenge on all the people this person tried to replace me with. 
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">I wish you could see me dressed for the kill</q>
            <p>
              finally had enough

            <q class="lyrics-line">Your eyes</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">They turn me</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Why should I stay here?</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Why should I stay?</q><br/>
            
            <p>
              i think this is me being stuck at rock bottom with no hope, but i've been here before. borderline sucidal, why should i stay here?
              but then you came into my life. your eyes seduced me, but i would not fall for it so easily. why should i, when nothing else helped?
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">I'd be crazy not to follow</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Follow where you lead</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Your eyes</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">They turn me</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Turn me on to phantoms (Way out)</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">I follow to the edge (Way Out)</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Of the earth (Way out)</q><br/>
            
            <p>
              now that i have found you i feel i have a chance. i feel like i dont have to suffer anymore. i feel i can escape. your eyes haunt me.
              i will follow you where you lead me. even off the earth, whereever you go i will too.  
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">And fall off</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">If they get the chance (Way out)</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">And this (Way Out)</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Is my chance</q><br/>
            
            <p>
              while i was so lost in your eyes, you lead me off the edge of the world. i fell further than i ever have. the love was fake. this is what happened
              everytime, this is what everyone does; they leave. they leave because i give them a chance. now it's my chance to leave. this is my way out.
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">I get eaten by the worms</q><br/>

            <p>
              laying on the bottom of the earth that i fell off of. i have nothing, i have worms in my stomach eating me from inside. i have fishes poking at me from outside.
              why did you leave?
            </p>
            
            <q class="lyrics-line">Yeah I</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">I'll hit the bottom</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Hit the bottom and escape, escape</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">And I</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">I'll hit the bottom</q><br/>
            <q class="lyrics-line">Hit the bottom and escape, escape</q><br/>
            
            <p>
              drowning in pity. this happens everytime, but everytime i escape. everytime i make it and this time i will too.
